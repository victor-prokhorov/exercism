# Raindrops

Welcome to Raindrops on Exercism's MIPS Assembly Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

Raindrops is a slightly more complex version of the FizzBuzz challenge, a classic interview question.

## Instructions

Your task is to convert a number into its corresponding raindrop sounds.

If a given number:

- is divisible by 3, add "Pling" to the result.
- is divisible by 5, add "Plang" to the result.
- is divisible by 7, add "Plong" to the result.
- **is not** divisible by 3, 5, or 7, the result should be the number as a string.

## Examples

- 28 is divisible by 7, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be `"Plong"`.
- 30 is divisible by 3 and 5, but not 7, so the result would be `"PlingPlang"`.
- 34 is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be `"34"`.

~~~~exercism/note
A common way to test if one number is evenly divisible by another is to compare the [remainder][remainder] or [modulus][modulo] to zero.
Most languages provide operators or functions for one (or both) of these.

## Registers

| Register | Usage        | Type    | Description                   |
| -------- | ------------ | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `$a0`    | input        | integer | given number                  |
| `$a1`    | input/output | address | null-terminated result string |
| `$t0-9`  | temporary    | any     | for temporary storage         |
